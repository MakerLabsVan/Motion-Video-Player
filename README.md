# Motion-Video-Player

This program plays a video at the 1st instance of motion detected by an infrared sensor. Once the video is done, the program will start to listen to the sensor again. The video file is on local storage and is played through the composite video port on a Raspberry Pi. A simple bash command is entered to start the video.
